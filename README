Fred's Vim Lisp

This plugin allows you to run a Lisp interpreter in a Vim window and send Lisp expressions to it. You can send selected lines, a [count] number of lines, or a range of lines.

fvl.vim defines a handful of commands:
    LispOpen     opens the lisp window and starts the lisp interpreter
    LispClose    close the lisp window and terminate lisp. This happens automatically when the lisp buffer is closed.
    LispRefresh  try and read from lisp when your in a pinch.
    LispDo       like perldo. Evaluate a lisp expression. You MUST escape quotes.
    LispCount    evaluate [count] lines.
    LispRange    evaluate a range of lines.

In practice, all you need to remember is LispDo and possibly LispRange.
I've added the following mapping to my .vimrc file:

map <C-L> :LispRange

That map allows you to hit <C-L> to send a single line to the lisp interpreter, or select a few lines and send them all together.


NOTE: There is already another script that does similar things to fvl.vim, vimscript #221 (VIlisp.vim). What's the difference? Mostly, fvl.vim requires only one file (the plugin file) to work and is a bit easier to setup (imho).
